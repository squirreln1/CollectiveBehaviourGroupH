## Introduction : 
We were looking for an article which highlight the collective behavior of ants which interested us as we found their group behaviour impressive. We settled for this paper : "An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant". Not only does it explain single ants behaviour, but it also studies how individual parameters lead to collective decisions, in particular during househunting in a mass-recruting ant species. 


## Starting point :
"An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant" - research paper by Adam Colin from October 2018 : 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519318303175?casa_token=0QGBiNCPEHwAAAAA:uuc350JLVjmPiYZWk9JuRsnalEOcBd7Qo73Nmcod5xDX2yM3wn0349G9GgVh8xDD6Cx--Bq7_Q


## Steps of the project : 
**Phase 1 : recreating the model presented in the paper.** 
The model aims to replicate the natural behavior of these ants during nest-site selection. The ants rely on pheromone trails for navigation and recruitment and use quorum thresholds for collective decisions. The agent-based model is the paper was built in NetLogo, taking a stochastic and spatially explicit approach, with a focus on trail-based recruitment. 

**Phase 2:  test of the model through different parameters.**
The paper investigates a range of parameters and environmental factors to understand the dynamics of the ants collective behavior. We will reproduce these test and also try other parameters to see if the model can be improved and if so, how.

**Phase 3 : expend the model to another area.**
Finally, we will try to use the model to explain solve problems in other areas where a group of agents needs to find and choose the best option from a set of alternatives. We'll need to do more research but upon first look here are a couple of problems that could be solved using the ant nest site selection model : 
- routing traffic in a computer network
- scheduling tasks in a factory
- finding the shortest path between two points in a graph



## Expected timeline :

Here is how we plan to carry out this project.

Phase 1 : 23/10/2023 - 19/11/2023
We will first make several research on the subject. We need to have a general understanding of how ants based models work and what model has been developped in this area. In parallele, will will install all tools needed to implement the model.
We will also try to implement a first version of our model which will be more or less developped depending on how much time we have after the researches. 
*19th November 2023 : First report* 

Phase 2 : 19/11/2023 - 17/12/2023
During these weeks, we will test our model accuracy with different parameters. Thanks to these tests, we'll be able to improve the model.
*17th December 2023 : Second report* 

Phase 3 : 17/12/2023 - 07/01/2024
We'll use the beginning of this phase to compensate for any delai we may have met in the precedent phase and have a optimise model.
Depending on how much time is left, we'll do research on how this model can be applied to other problems and test if it can solve them.
